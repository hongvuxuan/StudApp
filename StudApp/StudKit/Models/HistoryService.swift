/// Manages Core Data persistent history.

/// When using Core Data in multiple targets, e.g. an app as well as a file provider, it is crucial to merge changes from one
/// target into another because otherwise you would end up with inconsistent state. To that end, this Apple introduced
/// persistent history, which is a linear stream of changes that can be merged into the current context. This service takes
/// advantage of this feature by providing a simple interface for merging and deleting history. The latter is needed to free up
/// space after the history has been consumed by all targets. It uses history transactions' timestamps in order to determine
/// what to delete.
