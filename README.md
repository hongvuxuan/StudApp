# Setting Up a Development Environment

1. Download the most recent version of Xcode from the Mac App Store
2. Run `xcode-select --install` in your shell in order to install headers for `CommonCrypto`
3. Run `brew install swiftlint` for installing an addtional Swift linting tool
4. Run `brew install swiftformat` for installing a Swift source code formatting tool
5. Open `StudApp/StudApp.xcodeproj`

# Project Architecture

## Pattern

This project utilizes the [MVVM](TODO) _"Model-View-ViewModel"_ pattern, which leads to separation of view and business logic and makes both easier to reuse and test. Models can be found in _StudKit_, e.g. in the form of database models and services. View models also reside in _StudKit_. Views and controllers form the View part of MVVM.

## Dependency Injection

## Layout

StudApp is divided into three distinct targets (and accompanying testing targets), namely _StudApp_, _StudKit_, and _StudFileProvider_.

**StudApp** is the actual iOS application with all view controllers and storyboards except those shared by multiple targets.

**StudKit** is a common framework containing all models, view models, services, views as well as shared view controllers and storyboards.

**StudFileProvider** integrates with the native iOS Files application.
